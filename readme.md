A tool for remembering my coffee, based on [James Hoffman's french press recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8&t=51s&ab_channel=JamesHoffmann)

It pings after 4 minutes to remind you to stir
It pings again after a further 5 minutes to let you know it's done


TO DO

- dynamically update page title to see in chrome tab
- add a problem statement page
- further styling (maybe a progress bar?)
